"""
Measurement nomenclature — the counterpart of `Event` for audit records that
state HOW MUCH work was done.

`Event` names the operation, `step` its phase; neither says what was moved. A
closing record that carries `size=`, `chars=` or `pages=` is already measuring,
but each component chose its own word, so a collector had to guess among them.
`Measure` fixes that vocabulary and, with it, the unit and the series a value
belongs to — so a number cannot arrive without saying what it counts.

Adding a member extends a controlled vocabulary and goes through a DR (D-12).
